# Which round of review this push is, and which commits it covers. Each kind of
# review (review, security) keeps one comment on the pull request with a marker
# that records the last commit it covered and the round. Round 1 reads the whole
# pull request, later rounds only the commits since, and after three rounds the
# review stops and asks the author to rethink, so an agent author and an agent
# reviewer cannot cycle all night.
#
# Security reads every line on round 1 but a later round only when the new
# commits are big or touch a risky path, as a fix push is a few lines and
# rereading it costs plan usage for nothing. A skipped round counts no round
# and leaves the marker where it was, so the next round that runs reads the
# skipped commits too.
#
#   round.sh plan    writes round, from, comment_id, stop, rerun, skip and max to $GITHUB_OUTPUT
#   round.sh record  writes the marker comment for this round
#
# Reads KIND, PR, BASE_SHA, HEAD_SHA and GH_TOKEN from the environment, and
# ROUND, FROM, COMMENT_ID and SKIP for record.
