"""How the CI review's findings were answered, for pull requests merged lately.

Counts each Important thread by the first word of the author's answer (Fixed,
Rejected, Intentional, Didn't matter), the rounds each pull request took, and
picks pull requests whose summaries held Design points for pgoell to read. An
agent author fixes whatever it is told, so the answers alone do not show a
finding was worth making; the sample is where a person judges that.
