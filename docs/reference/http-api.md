# HTTP API

The backend serves two endpoints. Both are read-only. The interactive schema is
at `/docs` while the backend runs, and the machine-readable one at
`/openapi.json`.

## GET /api/health

Reports that the process is up. It deliberately does not touch the database, so
it stays a liveness check and does not become a readiness check by accident.

```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

## GET /api/files

Lists every note in the vault as a relative POSIX path, sorted.

```json
["daily/2026-08-05.md", "index.md", "projects/kasten.md"]
```

The list is flat and the server keeps it that way. Folders are not modelled
anywhere in the backend; the frontend folds the paths into a tree. Hidden files
and directories are skipped, which keeps `.git` and editor dotfiles out. A
vault directory that does not exist reads as an empty one, so a fresh checkout
still serves.

Note content is not exposed yet. There is no endpoint that reads or writes a
single note.
