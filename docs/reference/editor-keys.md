# Editor keys

The editor runs vim. Everything on this page is what kasten adds on top of it;
every vim binding not listed here still does what vim does.

`frontend/src/lib/key-bindings.ts` holds these bindings as one table, and both
the registrations and the `<leader>?` panel are built from it. A test fails if
that table names a command the app does not provide.

## Leader

The leader is the space bar, in normal mode. Vim ships `<Space>` bound to `l`,
and kasten unmaps it so a sequence can begin there. Visual mode keeps
move-right, because the leader is registered in normal mode only.

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `<leader>b` | Fold the file tree away, or bring it back |
| `<leader>cf` | Open the new note prompt |
| `<leader>e` | Move the focus to the file tree |
| `<leader>p` | Turn live preview off, or back on |
| `<leader>q` | Write the note and close it |
| `<leader>rf` | Open the rename prompt |
| `<leader>?` | Show every binding on this page, in the app |

`<leader>cf` takes two keys after the leader, `c` then `f`, and is the first
binding here to take more than one. The `<leader>?` panel spells it
`Space c f`, one letter per press. From the editor it opens an empty prompt.
From the file tree it opens one already holding the folder the tree cursor sits
in, or the folder holding the note it sits on. The `＋` in the panel header
does the same with the mouse, reading the tree cursor the same way. [The note
prompt](#the-note-prompt) covers the keys inside it.

`<leader>rf` takes two keys the same way, `r` then `f`, and the panel spells it
`Space r f`. It opens the same prompt on a note that already exists, so the
input starts holding that note's whole path with the name selected: the folder
and the `.md` are what a rename usually keeps. From the editor it renames the
open note. From the file tree it renames the note the tree cursor sits on,
which need not be the one you are writing, and does nothing at all when the
cursor is on a folder. Renaming a folder would mean moving every note under it,
which is not this command.

A rename can change the whole path, so it moves a note between folders as well
as renaming it in place, making folders on the way and taking away the ones it
emptied. The note you are writing follows into the URL; renaming any other note
leaves the editor where it is. Text still waiting to be written is saved before
the prompt opens, so a rename never strands a keystroke at the old path.

`<leader>e` unfolds the tree first if it was folded away, and lands on the row
the tree cursor is already on. Escape in the tree comes back to the editor.

`<leader>q` closes the note only once the vault holds the text. A write that
fails leaves the note open with the warning in the status bar, because closing
unmounts the editor and the only copy of the edit would go with it.

`<leader>p` and `<leader>b` keep their setting while you move between notes,
and start again from on and open when you reload the page.

## Formatting

These apply in insert and visual mode. Vim owns all four in normal mode, where
they page up, walk the jump list, and decrement a number, and they keep doing
that. The bindings carry a mode and vim's own do not, which is what leaves
normal mode alone.

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| Ctrl+B | `**bold**` |
| Ctrl+I | `*italic*` |
| Ctrl+Shift+H | `==highlight==` |
| Ctrl+Shift+X | `~~strikethrough~~` |

Each one toggles. With text selected it wraps the selection. With nothing
selected it wraps the word under the cursor. With the cursor already inside the
marks it removes them. On a blank line it opens an empty pair and leaves the
cursor between the halves. Used in visual mode, it returns to normal mode
afterwards, the way an operator does.

Highlight sits on Ctrl+Shift+H rather than Ctrl+H, which Chrome spends on its
history window.

`==highlight==` is not part of any markdown flavour kasten loads, so
`frontend/src/lib/markdown-highlight.ts` adds it to the parser. A delimiter
opens only when a non-space follows it and closes only when a non-space
precedes it, which keeps `a == b` out of it.

## Backticks

A backtick closes itself, the way a bracket and a quote already did. Markdown
ships no bracket list of its own, so the editor was using the default set from
`@codemirror/autocomplete`, and a backtick was not in it.

| Typed | You get |
| --- | --- |
| `` ` `` | `` `` `` with the cursor between the pair |
| `` `` `` | The cursor steps over the closing one |
| ``` ``` ``` | A whole fenced block, with the cursor on the empty line inside |

The third backtick is handled separately, because closing brackets alone would
leave four of them on the line: one pair from the first keystroke, the second
stepping over it, and the third opening a pair of its own. It only fires when
the line holds the pair and nothing else, so a backtick typed mid-sentence
still just opens a pair.

## Indenting

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| Tab | Indent the line, which nests a list item under the one above |
| Shift+Tab | Lift the line back out |

Both act on the line rather than the cursor, so the indent goes in at the front
of the line wherever in it you are pressing the key. CodeMirror leaves Tab
unbound by default so the key can move the focus out of the editor. Binding it
takes that away, which is what `<leader>e` is for.

The unit is two spaces. Neither key is a list key: they indent a plain line the
same way, and an ordered list the same way as a bulleted one.

## The file tree

These apply while the tree holds the focus. `<leader>e` reaches the row the
cursor is on, and these keys move it from there.

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `j` / `k` | Move the cursor down or up |
| `h` | Collapse the folder, or go to its parent |
| `l` | Expand the folder, or open the note |
| Enter | Open the note under the cursor |
| `gg` / `G` | Go to the first or last row |
| `q` | Close the file tree |
| Escape | Back to the editor |

Leader sequences work here too, so `<leader>b` closes the tree from inside it.

## The note prompt

`<leader>cf` and `<leader>rf` open the same prompt over the editor, one to make
a note and one to move a note that is there. Type where the note goes, relative
to the vault root, and `.md` is added unless you typed it. Under the input sits
the list of the vault's folders, ranked against what you have typed, best
first, and never more than twenty rows.

The header says which of the two you are in, `new note` or `rename note`.

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| Down / Up | Move the highlight through the folders |
| Ctrl+N / Ctrl+P | The same two, the way vim's completion moves |
| Tab | Take the highlighted folder, leaving the caret after its slash |
| Enter | Make the note or move it, per the line under the list |
| Escape | Close the prompt and give the focus back |

Clicking a folder does what Tab does. Either way the folder replaces the whole
input rather than joining what is there, because the whole input was the query
it was ranked against.

That same rule is what empties the list once you have typed the note's own
name: `reading` matches `reading/`, and `reading/borges` matches no folder at
all. Tab is for before you name the note, not after.

The line under the list says what Enter will do, and Enter does what it says.
It reads `creates folder reading/` for a folder the vault does not have yet, or
why the path is refused, so `name the note` for one ending in a slash. It says
nothing where the input already spells out the whole story. An input naming no
note leaves Enter with nothing to do. A write the vault refused leaves the
typed path where it is and says `could not create the note` or `could not
rename the note`, so the next Enter tries again.

A path a note is already at is the one line the two modes read differently.
Making a note there is opening it, so the line says `already exists, Enter
opens it`. Moving a note there would write over it, which the vault refuses, so
the line says `a note is already there` and Enter does nothing. The exception
is the note's own path, which a rename starts on: Enter closes the prompt
rather than refusing, because leaving a name alone is not a collision.

Escape hands the focus back where it came from, the editor or the tree.
Opening a note is the exception: the focus goes to the editor, in normal mode,
so you can type into a new note at once.

## Saving

| Key | Does | Mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `:w` | Write the note | normal |
| Ctrl+S | Write the note | any |

Neither is new to this page. Writing also happens on its own, about a second
after you stop typing.
